            <h2>Homemade Brown Sugar Bubble Tea</h2>
            <p>
                I drank black sugar bubble tea every day when I visited Taiwan
                and decided to bring back some tapioca pearls (boba) to make my
                own at home. This is a versatile recipe: you can vary the tea
                and milk you use and sweeten it to taste. Brew tea to your
                preferred strength, though it's a good idea to use strong tea
                because you're going to dilute it with milk and ice. You'll need
                a wide straw to drink the boba, or use a long spoon for fishing
                them out!

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add
                    tapioca pearls and stir gently until they begin floating to
                    the top. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until softened and
                    dark, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit
                    for 15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, bring 2 cups water to a boil. Remove from heat
                    and add tea leaves. Let steep for 15 minutes. Strain out tea
                    leaves and refrigerate tea.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drain pearls. Bring 1/4 cup water to a boil in the empty
                    saucepan. Stir in brown sugar until dissolved. Immerse
                    pearls in syrup and let sit until room temperature, about 15
                    minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Divide pearls and desired amount of syrup between 2 tall
                    glasses. Pour in tea.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add ice, milk, and sweetened condensed milk to both glasses.
                    Stir before drinking.
