            <h2>What Is Sushi Rice?</h2>
            <p>
                Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation
                method. It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice
                vinegar and other ingredients, cooled completely, and then used
                to make sushi rolls.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you
                make homemade lasagna:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>
                    Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander under cold running
                    water until the water runs clear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat
                    and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook
                    until rice is tender and all water has been absorbed, about
                    20 minutes. Remove from stove and set aside until cool
                    enough to handle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a
                    small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has
                    dissolved. Allow to cool, then stir into the cooked rice.
                    While mixture will appear very wet at first, keep stirring
                    and rice will dry as it cools.
                </li>
            </ul>
